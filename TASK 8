import csv

# ---------- TXT FILE HANDLING ----------

try:
    # 1 & 2. Create and write data to text file
    with open("users.txt", "w") as file:
        file.write("Name: Mouna\n")
        file.write("Course: Python\n")
        file.write("Status: Intern\n")

    # 3. Read file contents
    print("Reading users.txt:")
    with open("users.txt", "r") as file:
        print(file.read())

    # 4. Append data to file
    with open("users.txt", "a") as file:
        file.write("Location: India\n")

except IOError as e:
    print("File error occurred:", e)

# ---------- CSV FILE HANDLING ----------

try:
    # 6 & 7. Create CSV file and write multiple rows
    with open("students.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(["ID", "Name", "Marks"])
        writer.writerow([101, "Asha", 85])
        writer.writerow([102, "Ravi", 90])
        writer.writerow([103, "Mouna", 95])

    # 8. Read CSV data
    print("\nReading students.csv:")
    with open("students.csv", "r") as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        for row in reader:
            print(row)

except IOError as e:
    print("CSV file error occurred:", e)
